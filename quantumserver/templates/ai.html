<h3><a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/74">[ARTICLE 1]: Viewpoint: Neural Networks Take on Open Quantum Systems</a></h3>

<p>Simulating a quantum system that exchanges energy with the outside world is notoriously hard, but the necessary computations might be easier with the help of neural networks.

Neural networks are behind technologies that are revolutionizing our daily lives, such as face recognition, web searching, and medical diagnosis. These general problem solvers reach their solutions by being adapted or “trained” to capture correlations in real-world data. Having seen the success of neural networks, physicists are asking if the tools might also be useful in areas ranging from high-energy physics to quantum computing <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10563.pdf">[Machine learning and the physical sciences]</a>. Four research groups now report on using neural network tools to tackle one of the most computationally challenging problems in condensed-matter physics—simulating the behaviour of an open many-body quantum system [2–5]. This scenario describes a collection of particles—such as the qubits in a quantum computer —that both interact with each other and exchange energy with their environment. For certain open systems, the new work might allow accurate simulations to be performed with less computer power than existing methods.</p></div><br><br>

<p>Up until now, chip-makers have been piggybacking on the renowned Moore’s Law for delivering successive generations of chips that have more compute capabilities and are less power hungry. Now, these advancements are slowly coming to a halt. Researchers around the world are proposing alternative architectures to continue producing systems which are faster and more energy efficient. This article discusses those alternatives and reasons why one of them might have an edge over others in averting the chip design industry from getting stymied.</p></div><br><br>

<h3><a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/74">[ARTICLE 3]: Thanks to AI, we know we can teleport qubits in the real world</a></h3>
<p>Italian researchers have shown that it is possible to teleport a quantum bit (or qubit) in what might be called a real-world situation.
And they did it by letting artificial intelligence do much of the thinking.
The phenomenon of qubit transfer is not new, but this work, which was led by Enrico Prati of the Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnologies in Milan, is the first to do it in a situation where the system deviates from ideal conditions.</p></div><br><br>

<p>When it comes to technology trends, AI has been undeniably leading the way in recent years and is expected to continue to do so for decades to come.
From self-driving cars to predictive medicine and personalized learning, AI is increasingly shaping both practical and intimate aspects of our everyday lives, including matching us to our better halves.When talking about AI, we often are interested in the application use cases: what is AI going to enable next? In the race towards building powerful AI systems and applications, the public, including tech-domain experts, often dismisses the close interconnection between AI and computing. However, the AI revolution that we are witnessing could not have happened without the evolution of the computing hardware and of the computing ecosystem.</p></div><br><br>
