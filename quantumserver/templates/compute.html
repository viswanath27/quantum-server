<p>Despite giving us the most spectacular wave of technological innovation in human history, there are certain computational problems that the digital revolution still can’t seem to solve. Some of these problems could be holding back key scientific breakthroughs, and even the global economy. Although conventional computers have been doubling in power and processing speed nearly ever two years for decades, they still don’t seem to be getting any closer to solving these persistent problems. Want to know why? Ask any computer scientist, and they’ll probably give you the same answer: today’s digital, conventional computers are built on a classical, and very limited, model of computing. In the long run, to efficiently solve the world’s most persistent computing problems, we’re going to have to turn to an entirely new and more capable animal: the quantum computer.</p></div><br><br>

<p>Google is close to realising a practical quantum computer for the first time after making a major discovery with the revolutionary form of computing.
Hartmut Neven, director of Google’s Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, revealed to Quanta magazine that his lab’s most advanced quantum processor was improving at a rate far beyondwhat they had previously thought possible.The revelation means the tech giant may be just months away from achieving what is known as quantum supremacy, whereby quantum computers are able to solve problems that classical computers practically cannot.</p></div><br><br>

<p>D-Wave today announced the general availability of D-Wave Hybrid, its open source hybrid workflow platform for building and running quantum-classical hybrid applications. You can download D-Wave Hybrid, which is part of the company’s Ocean SDK, from GitHub.Binary digits (bits) are the basic units of information in classical computing, while quantum bits (qubits) make up quantum computing. Bits are always in a state of 0 or 1, while qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of the two. Quantum computing leverages qubits to perform computations that would be much more difficult for a classical computer. Hybrid computing lets classical and quantum systems be utilized in parallel. (D-Wave’s quantum computers use quantum annealing.</p></div><br><br>

<h3><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/googles-quantum-processor-may-achieve-quantum-supremacy-in-months">[ARTICLE 5]: Google's Quantum Processor May Achieve Quantum Supremacy in Months</a></h3>
<p>Moore's Law famously held that computer processor power would double about every two years, but now, Neven's Law appears to show quantum computing's explosive, 'doubly exponential' growth.While I said several months ago that we'd find a way to bring Moore's Law back, I didn't expect it to go down like this. In a new report in Quanta Magazine by Kevin Hartnett, HartmutNeven, the director of Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, reveals that the growth in power with each new improvement to Google's best quantum processor is unlike anything found in nature. It's growing at not just an exponential rate, like in Moore's Law, but at a doubly-exponential rate, meaning we may be mere months away from the beginning of the practical quantum computing era.Google's Hartmut Neven is Telling Us to Get Ready Hartnett's piece should be a major wake-up call for the world. As we've plodded along, thinking that tomorrow would be more or less like today, something extraordinary appears to be taking place at Google's Quantum AI labs in Santa Barbara, California. In December 2018, Neven and his team began running a calculation on the company's best quantum processor when they began to see something unbelievable.</p></div><br><br>

<h3><a href="https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/computers-promises-of-the-quantum-dawn">[ARTICLE 6]: Computers: Promises of the Quantum Dawn</a></h3>
<p>Long a simple physicist's idea, the quantum computer, which promises to revolutionise computing, is increasingly becoming a tangible reality. The first machines able to surpass traditional computers should appear in a few years.The world's most powerful supercomputers could soon be relegated to the prehistory of computing. For the most optimistic, the next few years will see the arrival of a new kind of machine known as quantum computer, offering phenomenal computing capacities. Imagined during the early 1980s by the winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, Richard Feynman, the concept of such a computer is today increasingly becoming a reality.  "We are currently experiencing a pivotal period in which industrial actors like Google and IBM have seized upon the subject,which had previously been the domain of research laboratories. This will help us overcome major technological issues," enthuses Tristan Meunier of the Institut Néel.1 It's the same story for Eleni Diamanti of the Laboratoire d'informatique de Paris 6.2 "In the coming years we will have quantum computers that perform well enough to beat traditional computers on certain problems."</p></div><br><br>

<h3><a href="https://m.phys.org/news/2019-06-path-reliable-quantum.html">[ARTICLE 7]: Researchers demonstrate new path to reliable quantum computation</a></h3>
<p>Researchers at the University of Chicago published a novel technique for improving the reliability of quantum computers by accessing higher energy levels than traditionally considered. Most prior work in quantum computation deals with "qubits," the quantum analogue of binary bits that encode either zero or one. The new work instead leverages "qutrits," quantumanalogues of three-level trits capable of representing zero, one or two. The UChicago group worked alongside researchers based at Duke University. Both groups are part of the EPiQC (Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computation) collaboration, an NSF Expedition in Computing. EPiQC's interdisciplinary research spans from algorithm and software development to architecture and hardware design, with the ultimate goal of more quickly realizing the enormous potential of quantum computing for scientific discovery and computing innovation.</p></div><br><br>
