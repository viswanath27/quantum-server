<h3><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-vs-blockchain-impact-on-cryptography/amp">[ARTICLE 1]: Quantum Computing Vs. Block-chain: Impact on Cryptography</a></h3>
<p>

Blockchain vulnerabilities due to advent of the quantum computing is dicussed in this article. Example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor&apos;s algorithm</a> is quoted of how it can replace the present cryptography algorithms. Blockchain heavliy depends on the one sided fucntion, which are difficult to reverse, for its ledger validation. If a quantum computer gets into improper hands all sorts of compromise can happen to Block chain transactions. Thought have to be initiated to adapt quantum computer resistant algorithms in Block chain technology. Also may, Quantum internet can bring new changes of how Block chain is operating today which will leverage Quantum Entanglement, there are few studies also in this direction<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05979.pdf">Link</a>. Estimate is roughly in 10 years from now quantum era would start and cryptography should evolve with Quantum resistant algorithms.  </p></div><br><br>

<h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/21/cloudflare-quantum-encryption/">[ARTICLE 2]: Cloud Fare wants to protect internet from Quantum Computing</a></h3>
<p>
Quantum computing has the capacity to change all the domains of how they operate today. With the advances in quantum computing and its access it can easily break into sensitve data. Cloud fare is working to test the post quantum cryptography technology. There is an open source software package <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/circl">CIRCL</a> or also called as "Cloudflare Interoperable Reusable Cryptographic Library". Cloud is trying to imporve upon the SSL which is the basis for client server authentication. By openly making this library available, Cloud fare sees collaborative effort to address the cryptography problem.</p></div><br><br>

<h3><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls/amp/">[ARTICLE 3]: QUANTUM COMPUTERS COULD BE TRUE RANDOMNESS GENERATORS</a></h3>
<p>"Quantum Supremacy" is possible to be achieved faster than it is thought. Google's quantum computing is towards the goal of "Generating pure random numbers" which can be majore application of Quantum computers. Superposition which is random probability of state of given qbit at any time can form the basis for this randomness. Sampling this state is the algorithm proposed where at any given point of time the output is underterministic. As the qbits in this case increase, the output random state will be hard to predict. There can be a probability distribution in which dictates the quantum bits can output sting. The entropy of this 50 bit string will be unpredictable. In combination with classical and quantum computer there can be purely random (entropy which no calssical computer can generate) and feed this number to classical algorithm (Aaronson's Protocol). Reference of Trapdoor claw-free function is made here to really verify the randomness of the number generated, which other wise is very difficult for super computer also to do so.  </p></div><br><br>

<h3> <a href="https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls/amp/">[ARTICLE 4]:Towards Post-Quantum Cryptography in TLS</a></h3>
<p>We live in a completely connected society. A society connected by a variety of devices: laptops, mobile phones, wearables, self-driving or self-flying things. We have standards for a common language that allows these devices to communicate with each other. This is critical for wide-scale deployment – especially in cryptography where the smallest detail has great importance.
One of the most important standards-setting organizations is the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is hugely influential in determining which standardized cryptographic systems see worldwide adoption. At the end of 2016, NIST announced it would hold a multi-year open project with the goal of standardizing new post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic algorithms secure against both quantum and classical computers.Many of our devices have very different requirements and capabilities, so it may not be possible to select a “one-size-fits-all” algorithm during the process. NIST mathematician, Dustin Moody, indicated that institute will likely select more than one algorithm:</p> </div><br><br>
